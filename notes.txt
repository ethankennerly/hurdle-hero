Hurdle Dash
Steeple Chase
Rhythm Rider
Paperboy

Riding on a bicycle delivering papers to houses.

The houses have a few signs.  Press the right key to toss to the same house.  Press the left key to toss the opposite house.  Time the press.  A miss slows down the bicycle.  The bicycler tosses the paper up or down screen to avoid confusion with left and right arrow keys.  This is a form of a metronome.
